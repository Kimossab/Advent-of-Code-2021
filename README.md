My stupid solutions to the AoC of 2021

These are all my solutions for the AoC of 2021 in typescript, they are not properly optimised and all could be heavily refactored.  
The reason being it's my first solution for each puzzle and I was focused on finding the solution (even if sometimes the code is slow).

## How to run
If you want to run this (I don't know why you would, there's better solutions out there) you can follow the same way as every other TS project ever:

Note: needless to say, but I'll say it anyway, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Install packages:
```
npm i
```

To run development locally (will auto restart the program on file updates):
```
npm run dev
```

To build (this will build into javascript and then you can run the resulting js file):
```
npm run build
```

Also needless to say you can use `yarn` instead of `npm` if that's what you fancy, but you might want to delete `package-lock.json` first.
